# Hiboot web application demo

This is the Hiboot web application demo, we are going to demonstrate Hiboot we application programming step by step.

## Step 1, Writing the first Hiboot web application

To write Hiboot application, as we know, the executable commands must always use package main, so we need to create the main package first.

See [Effective GO](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names) to learn more about Go's naming conventions.

## Step 2, adding some starters

Here we are going to add starter [actuator](https://hidevops.io/hiboot/tree/master/pkg/starter/actuator) and [logging](https://hidevops.io/hiboot/tree/master/pkg/starter/logging).

### Writing the code

```go
package main

import (
	"hidevops.io/hiboot/pkg/app/web"
	"hidevops.io/hiboot/pkg/app"
	"hidevops.io/hiboot/pkg/starter/actuator"
	"hidevops.io/hiboot/pkg/starter/logging"
)

func main()  {
	web.NewApplication().
		SetProperty(app.ProfilesInclude, actuator.Profile, logging.Profile).
		Run()
}
```

### Run the web application

As shown above, we just start the application, we did not write any business logic yet. But it's runnable, let's take a look,

```bash
go run main.go
```

The output will be,

```bash
______  ____________             _____

__  /_/ /__  /__  __ \  __ \  __ \  __/

[INFO] 2018/10/26 18:44 Starting Hiboot web application hiboot-app on localhost with PID 16703
[INFO] 2018/10/26 18:44 Working directory: /Users/johnd/.gvm/pkgsets/go1.10/hidevops/src/hidevops.io/hiboot-web-app-demo
[INFO] 2018/10/26 18:44 The following profiles are active: default, [actuator logging]

[INFO] 2018/10/26 18:44 Auto configure logging starter
Now listening on: http://localhost:8080
Application started. Press CMD+C to shut down.

```

As you can see above, the starter actuator and logging is auto configured.

Now we have health check endpoint GET /health, let's use [httpie](https://httpie.org/) to check this endpoint.

```bash
http :8080/health
```

We can see the output of above request, my first Hiboot application is up and running. Yeah!

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 15
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Date: Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:49:12 GMT

{
    "status": "UP"
}
```

The application log also prints the request info.

```bash

[INFO] 2018/10/26 18:49 200 215.239Âµs ::1 GET /health HTTPie/0.9.3

```
